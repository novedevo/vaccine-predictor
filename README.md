# vaccine-predictor

This tool automatically fetches the latest data from the British Columbia CDC and a third-party data aggregator, filters, cleans, and processes it, graphs it, and fits a cubic forecast polynomial.
Demographic data is also shown on the output graph.
As the vaccination campaign progresses, the forecast will improve due to the additional data.
