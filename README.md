# vaccine-predictor

This tool automatically fetches the latest data from the British Columbia CDC and a third-party data aggregator, filters, cleans, and processes it, graphs it, and collates demographic data.
As the vaccination campaign has progressed since thie project began, the graphs have changed.
The forecast has been removed, since everyone may get vaccinated **right now**!
Second doses are being distributed with celerity, and forecasts are less useful than they were a few months ago.

If you're reading this after COVID-19 vaccination is complete, the API endpoints may no longer be functional.

To view the rendered notebook and graph, view `vaccine-predictor.ipynb`. GitHub's Jupyter notebook rendering seems a little shaky, so if it doesn't look right, you might have to clone the repo or download the .ipynb file to open in your local installation.
